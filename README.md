# About

This repo is an unofficial mirror (possibly not synchronized) of
<https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pdfshuffler/> and
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/>.

I set it up because I feel frustrated to work with subversion and without PR.
The developer of pdfshuffler do not read this repo so don't expect any PR or
issues posted here to reach him.

I just use this repo to keep my own patches and, as a source for `pip install`.

See <https://github.com/jeromerobert/pdfshuffler/issues/9> for details.
